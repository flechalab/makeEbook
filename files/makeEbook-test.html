        <h2 id="about_version_control">About Version Control</h2>

<p>What is version control, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.</p>

<p>If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.</p>

<h3 id="local_version_control_systems">Local Version Control Systems</h3>

<p>Many people&rsquo;s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they&rsquo;re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you&rsquo;re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don&rsquo;t mean to.</p>

<p>To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control (see Figure 1-1).</p>

<p><br> Figure 1-3. Distributed version control diagram.</p>

<p>Furthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project. This allows you to set up several types of workflows that aren&rsquo;t possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.</p>

        <h2 id="a_short_history_of_git">A Short History of Git</h2>

<p>As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy. The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope. For most of the lifetime of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991&ndash;2002), changes to the software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS system called BitKeeper.</p>

<p>In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool&rsquo;s free-of-charge status was revoked. This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper. Some of the goals of the new system were as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Speed</li>

<li>Simple design</li>

<li>Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)</li>

<li>Fully distributed</li>

<li>Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)</li>
</ul><p>Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial qualities. It&rsquo;s incredibly fast, it&rsquo;s very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development (See Chapter 3).</p>

        <h2 id="git_basics">Git Basics</h2>

<p>So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as Subversion and Perforce; doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Git stores and thinks about information much differently than these other systems, even though the user interface is fairly similar; understanding those differences will help prevent you from becoming confused while using it.</p>

<h3 id="snapshots_not_differences">Snapshots, Not Differences</h3>

<p>The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time, as illustrated in Figure 1-4.</p>

<p><br> Figure 1-6. Working directory, staging area, and git directory.</p>

<p>The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.</p>

<p>The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.</p>

<p>The staging area is a simple file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It&rsquo;s sometimes referred to as the index, but it&rsquo;s becoming standard to refer to it as the staging area.</p>

<p>The basic Git workflow goes something like this:</p>

<ol><li>You modify files in your working directory.</li>

<li>You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.</li>

<li>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.</li>
</ol><p>If a particular version of a file is in the git directory, it&rsquo;s considered committed. If it&rsquo;s modified but has been added to the staging area, it is staged. And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified. In Chapter 2, you&rsquo;ll learn more about these states and how you can either take advantage of them or skip the staged part entirely.</p>

        <h2 id="installing_git">Installing Git</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get into using some Git. First things first&mdash;you have to install it. You can get it a number of ways; the two major ones are to install it from source or to install an existing package for your platform.</p>

<h3 id="installing_from_source">Installing from Source</h3>

<p>If you can, it&rsquo;s generally useful to install Git from source, because you&rsquo;ll get the most recent version. Each version of Git tends to include useful UI enhancements, so getting the latest version is often the best route if you feel comfortable compiling software from source. It is also the case that many Linux distributions contain very old packages; so unless you&rsquo;re on a very up-to-date distro or are using backports, installing from source may be the best bet.</p>

<p>To install Git, you need to have the following libraries that Git depends on: curl, zlib, openssl, expat, and libiconv. For example, if you&rsquo;re on a system that has yum (such as Fedora) or apt-get (such as a Debian based system), you can use one of these commands to install all of the dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>$ yum install curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel \
  openssl-devel zlib-devel

$ apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev gettext \
  libz-dev libssl-dev</code></pre>

<p>When you have all the necessary dependencies, you can go ahead and grab the latest snapshot from the Git web site:</p>

<pre><code>http://git-scm.com/download</code></pre>

<p>Then, compile and install:</p>

<pre><code>$ tar -zxf git-1.7.2.2.tar.gz
$ cd git-1.7.2.2
$ make prefix=/usr/local all
$ sudo make prefix=/usr/local install</code></pre>

<p>After this is done, you can also get Git via Git itself for updates:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git</code></pre>

<h3 id="installing_on_linux">Installing on Linux</h3>

<p>If you want to install Git on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the basic package-management tool that comes with your distribution. If you&rsquo;re on Fedora, you can use yum:</p>

<pre><code>$ yum install git-core</code></pre>

<p>Or if you&rsquo;re on a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, try apt-get:</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-get install git-core</code></pre>

<h3 id="installing_on_mac">Installing on Mac</h3>

<p>There are two easy ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is to use the graphical Git installer, which you can download from the Google Code page (see Figure 1-7):</p>

<pre><code>http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer</code></pre>

<p><br> Figure 1-7. Git OS X installer.</p>

<p>The other major way is to install Git via MacPorts (<code>http://www.macports.org</code>). If you have MacPorts installed, install Git via</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo port install git-core +svn +doc +bash_completion +gitweb</code></pre>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to add all the extras, but you&rsquo;ll probably want to include +svn in case you ever have to use Git with Subversion repositories (see Chapter 8).</p>

<h3 id="installing_on_windows">Installing on Windows</h3>

<p>Installing Git on Windows is very easy. The msysGit project has one of the easier installation procedures. Simply download the installer exe file from the Google Code page, and run it:</p>

<pre><code>http://code.google.com/p/msysgit</code></pre>

<p>After it&rsquo;s installed, you have both a command-line version (including an SSH client that will come in handy later) and the standard GUI.</p>


        
      </div><div id="content-5">
        <h2 id="firsttime_git_setup">First-Time Git Setup</h2>

<p>Now that you have Git on your system, you&rsquo;ll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment. You should have to do these things only once; they&rsquo;ll stick around between upgrades. You can also change them at any time by running through the commands again.</p>

<p>Git comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variables can be stored in three different places:</p>

<ul><li><code>/etc/gitconfig</code> file: Contains values for every user on the system and all their repositories. If you pass the option<code> --system</code> to <code>git config</code>, it reads and writes from this file specifically.</li>

<li><code>~/.gitconfig</code> file: Specific to your user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the <code>--global</code> option.</li>

<li>config file in the git directory (that is, <code>.git/config</code>) of whatever repository you&rsquo;re currently using: Specific to that single repository. Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in <code>.git/config</code> trump those in <code>/etc/gitconfig</code>.</li>
</ul><p>On Windows systems, Git looks for the <code>.gitconfig</code> file in the <code>$HOME</code> directory (<code>C:\Documents and Settings\$USER</code> for most people). It also still looks for /etc/gitconfig, although it&rsquo;s relative to the MSys root, which is wherever you decide to install Git on your Windows system when you run the installer.</p>

<h3 id="your_identity">Your Identity</h3>

<p>The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and e-mail address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it&rsquo;s immutably baked into the commits you pass around:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com</code></pre>

<p>Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the <code>--global</code> option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or e-mail address for specific projects, you can run the command without the <code>--global</code> option when you&rsquo;re in that project.</p>

<h3 id="your_editor">Your Editor</h3>

<p>Now that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message. By default, Git uses your system&rsquo;s default editor, which is generally Vi or Vim. If you want to use a different text editor, such as Emacs, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global core.editor emacs</code></pre>

<h3 id="your_diff_tool">Your Diff Tool</h3>

<p>Another useful option you may want to configure is the default diff tool to use to resolve merge conflicts. Say you want to use vimdiff:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global merge.tool vimdiff</code></pre>

<p>Git accepts kdiff3, tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge, vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge, and opendiff as valid merge tools. You can also set up a custom tool; see Chapter 7 for more information about doing that.</p>

<h3 id="checking_your_settings">Checking Your Settings</h3>

<p>If you want to check your settings, you can use the <code>git config --list</code> command to list all the settings Git can find at that point:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --list
user.name=Scott Chacon
user.email=schacon@gmail.com
color.status=auto
color.branch=auto
color.interactive=auto
color.diff=auto
...</code></pre>

<p>You may see keys more than once, because Git reads the same key from different files (<code>/etc/gitconfig</code> and <code>~/.gitconfig</code>, for example). In this case, Git uses the last value for each unique key it sees.</p>

<p>You can also check what Git thinks a specific key&rsquo;s value is by typing <code>git config {key}</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config user.name
Scott Chacon</code></pre>


        
      </div><div id="content-6">
        <h2 id="getting_help">Getting Help</h2>

<p>If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ git help &lt;verb&gt;
$ git &lt;verb&gt; --help
$ man git-&lt;verb&gt;</code></pre>

<p>For example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running</p>

<pre><code>$ git help config</code></pre>

<p>These commands are nice because you can access them anywhere, even offline. If the manpages and this book aren&rsquo;t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the <code>#git</code> or <code>#github</code> channel on the Freenode IRC server (irc.freenode.net). These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.</p>


        
      </div><div id="content-7">
        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>You should have a basic understanding of what Git is and how it&rsquo;s different from the CVCS you may have been using. You should also now have a working version of Git on your system that&rsquo;s set up with your personal identity. It&rsquo;s now time to learn some Git basics.</p>
